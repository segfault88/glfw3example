A Basic Go / Golang, OpenGL GLSL 3.3, GLU, GLFW2 Modern OpenGL Triangle drawing example.

I found it kind of frustrating to get a modern Open GL setup running in Go. Getting everything right to get a OpenGL 3.3 context, shaders and drawing a triangle took a whole lot of Googling and frustration.

It was possible to find examples with "old" OpenGL (fixed function pipeline etc.) or something else problematic.


Here is pretty much the most basic example.


Enjoy! Hopefully it might help somebody save a little frustration.
